# Fabric V1.0 Skeletal Environment
The V1.0 work is on its way (please see https://jira.hyperledger.org/browse/FAB-37 for details).

The approach being taken is to have a skeletal implementation in with minimal component hookups to enable

* users to run deploy and invoke Proposals to the peer
* allow incremental hooking up of components

**NOTE - None of the multi-peer network environment support in 0.5 is ready in the skeletal environment. The ONLY flow available currently in the skeletal environment is the one described here. This is hopefully a temporary state.**

The skeletal environment modifies the original CLI interface to send `deploy` and `invoke` requests to the `peer`.

## Steps for running a deploy and invoke

### Start the SOLO Orderer (First terminal)
* vagrant ssh
* cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/orderer
* make orderer
* orderer

### Start the peer (Second terminal)
* vagrant ssh
* rm /var/hyperledger/*
* cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric
* make peer
* peer node start

```
The CORE_PEER_COMMITTER_LEDGER_ORDERER env var is needed to override the `orderer` property in fabric/peer/core.yaml.
```

At this point you should see activity on the `orderer` window that the peer is in communication with the orderer. **If not, STOP.**

### Send a deploy request (Third terminal)
* vagrant ssh
* peer chaincode deploy -n mycc -p github.com/hyperledger/fabric/examples/chaincode/go/chaincode_example02 -c '{"Args":["init","a","100","b","200"]}'

Note the name of the chaincode is `mycc`.

The above should succeed and you should see activity in the `peer` terminal. After about 10 seconds there should be activity in the `orderer` terminal as well (by default the `solo` orderer waits for about 10 seconds to gather more transactions before delivering to the peer for committing.)

```
NOTE - you will also see the following error message in the `peer` window that the chaincode went down:

  Error handling chaincode support stream: stream error: code = 1 desc = "context canceled"

This is OK as the endorser brings down the chaincode after deploy pending a successful commit.
```

Copy the chaincode ID from the `peer` logs. For example

`d8f2ef95a72aa85b0f92580580176479fcd0874f6b0855ae21b98dcb926353d357e94cc80b5fb9b789d3a0acfdf143166b3bdc3e483feabeb4ab0b0a530b83a6`

is the ID from the `peer` log snippet

``18:22:52.813 [chaincode] deregisterHandler -> DEBU 0d7 Deregistered handler with key: d8f2ef95a72aa85b0f92580580176479fcd0874f6b0855ae21b98dcb926353d357e94cc80b5fb9b789d3a0acfdf143166b3bdc3e483feabeb4ab0b0a530b83a6``

```
Note - once we add the feature to replace system generated hash with user specified name for chaincode ID's this type of indirect means to discover chaincode IDs can be dispensed with
```

### Send a invoke request (still in the Third terminal)
peer chaincode invoke -n mycc  -c '{"Args":["invoke","a","b","10"]}'

The above should succeed and you should see activity in the `peer` and `orderer` terminals. The `invoke` command brings up the chaincode as shown by `docker ps` command.

## Conclusion
The CLI has been instrumented to

* convert the user request to a `Proposal` and send it to the `peer`
* receive a `ProposalResult` from the `peer`, convert it to a `Transaction` and send it to the `orderer`

The `orderer` will then send the transaction to the `peer` for committing to the ledger.

**NOTE - "Query" request has been disabled. However, "invoke" have been enhanced to collect the return value from the chaincode.**

```
Excercise

The `Invoke` method of the chaincode can be modified to return state values (chaincode_example02 returns nil). This can be a stronger indication of the commit at work - multiple invokes should show previously committed ledger values returned in ProposalResult.
```
